You have been asked by the medical institute to prepare a program, that for the given samples (cluster density), will find the epicenters of the "Lateral Sclerosis", 
and then determine the ideal surgical incision sites.
Epicentre is the sample whose two adjacent samples have the lower incidence density. Neither the first sample nor the last sample can be considered the epicenter. 
Depending on the patient's condition, a certain number of incisions can be made' and it is assumed that each successive incision cannot be made closer than the previous one. 
The answer to the task is the number of surgical incisions that can be made. 

Example 1:  
Number of possible incisions: 3
Sample set: 4 2 3 1 9 6 5 2 1

Answer: 2

Example 2:  
Number of possible incisions: 4
Sample set: 9 2 3 3 2 1 7 2 1 1 6 1 6 0 2 4 5 2

Answer: 3

Example 3:  
Number of possible strikes: 3
Sample set: 6 4 3 4 2 1 4 2 8 1 0 

Answer: 2

Example 4:  
Number of possible strikes: 2
Sample set: 6 4 3 4 2 1 4 2 8 1 0 

Answer: 2
